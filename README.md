A permit to work (PTW) is a formal document that authorizes specific tasks that are considered hazardous or non-routine. It outlines the scope of work, identifies potential risks, and specifies the safety precautions that must be followed.

Establishing a permit to work system creates a structure for handling activities in high-risk environments, such as construction sites and manufacturing plants. It’s designed to keep employees safe by mitigating environmental, health, sustainability, and safety risks in these hazardous operations. It’s often used as part of a control of work system.
